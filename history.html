        <h2>The Basics</h2>
        <img src="family_photo.jpg" alt="McAvoy Family Photo" class="float-left">
        <p>The McAvoy home was believed to be built in the early 1900's. It has never left family hands since it was built. The McAvoy family arrived in Webster County, WV from Bath County, Va in the early 1800's. The McAvoys came from Ulster, in Northern Ireland. My great-great grandfather James McAvoy purchased 300 acres of land in Webster County from his heirs and this home sits on that family land. This is not the first home of the family, but the last remaining "historic" home on the original property. </p>

    <h2>Architectural Style</h2>
    <img src="house_photor.jpg" alt="Photo of the historic McAvoy Home" class="float-right">
    <p>The McAvoy home is an American Four Square. Most four squares are four rooms over four rooms with a pyramid style roof. This was a very popular style of home for the early twentieth century. American four squares can have very simple or elaborate design. The McAvoy home is a very simple farmhouse. My mother told me that grandma always told her that it was never finished. This is evident with the lack of trim in some places. I have been told various information about its build. Some think the house plan was ordered from Sears, but I've not found any indication of that, or any plan from Sears during this time frame that is an exact match. My mother always heard that one of the locals by the last name of Hanshumaker had a hand in either the design or the build. So far, I have found no plans. My great grandfather owned a sawmill and it is believed that the lumber was from his own mill.</p>

<h2>A Moment in Time</h2>
<p>The home was built at the end of World War I. This was a time of change for America with prohibition, WV Coal Wars, and social upheaval. The home's setting in Webster County shows the challenge of the time. The area was isolated and remote that building materials and modern utilities were hard to get despite the rise in industry in other parts of the state. The home reflects how life was in a part of WV where roads and technology were slower to arrive than other places. As a kid, I helped Grandma draw water from the well and used an outdoor toilet! Rumor of public water coming to the area soon is exciting. There is currently no public water at the house.</p>

<h2>Fun Facts</h2>
<p>Two family members were born in this home. My mother was one of them!</p>
<p>The Governor of Virginia at the time (John Tyler) signed the Land Grant for this property. This would have been the President, John Tyler's father!</p>
<p>Although the property has been split across what is now called "Pleasant Ridge", all but one piece is still in the family!</p>
<p>My great grandfather Patrick Scott McAvoy gifted property for a school (my great grandmother use to board the teachers) and a family cemetary near the home. The school is no longer there, but the family cemetary is accessible.</p>
